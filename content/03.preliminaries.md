## Common definitions

In this section, we describe syntactic rules
shared across every logic formalism.

### Characters

Parsers MUST be able to accept sequence of _characters_ (see definition below)
which represent temporal logic formulae.
A _character_ 
is an atomic unit of text as specified by ISO/IEC 10646:2020
[@ISOUNICODE].
Legal characters are tab, carriage return, line feed, and the ASCII characters 
of Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646.

The range of characters to be supported
is defined as:
```
Char ::= #x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#x7e]
```

That is, the character tabulation, line feed, carriage return,
and all the printable ASCII characters.

## Boolean constants

For LTL and PLTL,
we use `true` and `false` to denote boolean constants.
For LDL and PLDL, we make a further distinction 
between _propositional_ 
booleans, denoted by `true` and `false`,
and _logical_ booleans, denoted by `tt` and `ff`.

```
True  ::= "true"
False ::= "false"
TT    ::= "tt"
FF    ::= "ff"
PropBooleans  ::= TRUE | FALSE
LogicBooleans ::= TT | FF
```

### Atomic Propositions

An atomic proposition is a string of characters. 
In particular, it can be:

- any string of printable characters, excepted the quotation character used (see `QuotedName`)
- any string of at least one character that starts with `[A-Za-z_]`
  and continues with `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.

```
NameStartChar ::= [A-Z] | [a-z] | "_"
NameChar ::= NameStartChar | [0-9]
Name ::= NameStartChar (NameChar)*
QuotedName ::= ('"' [^"\n\t\r]* '"') | ("'" [^'\n\t\r]* "'")
Atom ::= Name | QuotedName
```

### Boolean operators

The supported boolean operations 
are: negation, conjunction, disjunction,
implication, equivalence and exclusion.

Follows the list of characters used
for each operator:

- negation: `!`, `~`;
- conjunction: `&`, `&&`;
- disjunction: `|`, `||`;
- implication: `->`, `=>`;
- equivalence: `<->`, `<=>`;
- exclusive disjunction: `^`;

```
Non   ::= "!" | "~"
And   ::= "&" | "&&"
Or    ::= "|" | "||"
Impl  ::= "->" | "=>"
Equiv ::= "<->" | "<=>"
Xor   ::= "^"
```

### Parenthesis

We use `(` and `)` for parenthesis.

```
LeftParen  ::= "("
RightParen ::= ")"
```

### White Spaces

It is often convenient to use "white spaces" 
(spaces, tabs, and blank lines) to set apart the formulae for greater readability.
These characters MUST be ignored when processing the text input.
