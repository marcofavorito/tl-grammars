## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The heterogeneity of tools that support temporal logic formulae 
poses several challenges in terms of interoperability. 
In particular, a standard syntax for temporal logic on finite traces,
despite similar to the one for infinite traces, is currently missing. 
This document proposes a standard grammar for several temporal logic formalisms
interpreted over finite traces, like 
Linear Temporal Logic (LTLf),
Linear Dynamic Logic (LDLf), 
Pure-Past Linear Temporal Logic (PLTLf)
and Pure-Past Linear Dynamic Logic (PLDLf).
