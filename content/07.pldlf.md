## PLDLf

In this section, we specify a grammar for PLDLf.

### Temporal operators

PLDLf supports two temporal operators:

- _Backward diamond_ operator: `<<regex>>pldl_formula`;
- _Backward box_ operator: `[[regex]]pldl_formula`;

`regex` is the same as defined for LDLf.

```
LeftBackwardDiam  ::= "<<"
RightBackwardDiam ::= ">>"
LeftBackwardBox   ::= "[["
RightBackwardBox  ::= "]]"
```

In EBNF format, a PLDLf formula is defined as follows:

```
pldl_formula ::= TT
               | FF
               | LeftParen pldl_formula RightParen
               | Not pldl_formula 
               | pldl_formula And pldl_formula
               | pldl_formula Or pldl_formula
               | pldl_formula Impl pldl_formula
               | pldl_formula Equiv pldl_formula
               | LeftBackwardDiam regex RightBackwardDiam pldl_formula
               | LeftBackwardBox regex RightBackwardBox pldl_formula
```

For the semantics of the operators,
we refer to [@degiacomo2020].


### Precedence and associativity of operators

The precedence and associativity of the LDL operators are 
described by the following table (priorities from lowest to highest).
For brevity, aliases for boolean operators
are omitted.
