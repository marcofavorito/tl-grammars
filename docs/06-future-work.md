# Future work

In future versions of this standard, we would like to add:

- `Spot`-like syntactic sugars for regular expressions (SERE) and 
  temporal operators [@duret2016spot;@jacobs2016high];
- Compatibility with the PSL standard [@ieee2010];
- Support full Unicode characters, so
  to use UTF-8 characters
  like $\circ$ (U+25CB) for the Next operator
  and $\diamond$ (U+25C7) for the Eventually operator etc.
  as alternative symbols.
- Grammars for PLTL and PLDL.
